# Card-Memory-Game
A Card Memory Card Game I made in highschool using Java. The rules are quite simple: you will be flipping two cards at a time and the goal is to try to match two matching cards. Try to memorize all the flipped cards so you can win with the least number of moves. There are Easy mode (10 cards) and Hard Mode (14 cards). You can also customize the difficulty by choosing the number of cards (up to 20 cards).
